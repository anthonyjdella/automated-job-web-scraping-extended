#Automated Job Web Scraping Extended

This is the "production" version of my previous repository (**automated-job-web-scraping**) and aggregates job data from multiple companies.

The other repo is a proof of concept/demo/guide and is only for 1 company. To view that repo, [click here](https://github.com/anthonyjdella/automated-job-web-scraping).
